      "I got my Balayage from Ahmed Salon Powai. Hands down to the dedication shown by Ahmed and his team. They did not do it just for the sake of doing it but they wanted to look it perfect! They completed the work around 02:00AM at night and were so patient even at that hour. Hats off to you and your team Ahmed. Great work. Iâ€™m so happy and satisfied with the colour. Thank you so much! Highly recommended in Mumbai!",

      "I tried hair treatment, haircut, facial, and pedicure at Ahmed's salon. Salon's service was excellent. Even after moving to Canada, I made a point to visit his salon during my trips to India. It's renovated now, focusing on clients' needs with attention to small details. Ahmed's advice for the services is genuine, and personally, he's a very good human being. Interestingly, I paid after 2 days, but he didnâ€™t even call for that.",
